### If you build it, they will come.

Identifying new tourist destinations and increasing and improving related infrastructure and services is important. To sustain such new destinations and service providers, internal tourists play a vital role. Thus, Equal efforts should be made on promoting internal tourism.

### Niche markets

Niche markets include religious tourists mainly Hindus and Buddhists from India and Buddhists countries respectively. Maybe a separate campaign dedicated to pilgrimage would be a successful venture. It would help identify and preserve religiously important places that are scattered all over the country. 

India being a neighbor, shortest by distance and closer to us by our cultural and historic ties has to be identified as the biggest market for our tourism industry. Young Indians, growing middle class and higher middle class families from india with good purchasing/spending power is probably an untapped gold mine for nepali tourism. 

Similarly,  rekindling the hippie mood of Kathmandu would cater to some groups of people all over the world. 

Mountaineering is already doing well and is a unique identity to our country. Tell the world that the mountains are calling. 

### Marketing

If the goal is to bring 20 lakh tourists this year itself, the only effort that could give that result is marketing. Goodwill is developed over a large span of time. Word of mouth publicity takes its own course and depends largely on the quality of the product/experience.

*Targeted ads plus tailored packages*

In the age of digital technology where elections are supposedly won with ads on Facebook, it would be foolish not to leverage the power of targeted ads. How many people can an ad put on a bus reach ? On the other hand, targeted ads reach the right audience with the right message. An example, Showing ads of Pashupatinath and Muktinath to an Indian adult aged 30-60. Once that ad is clicked, make sure that the package that is offered is a click away and hassle free.

....

Performance of visit nepal 2020 would not  necessarily reflect the performance of the incumbent. Rather than fuss about the 2 million target, it is better to go steady aiming quality and sustainability.
